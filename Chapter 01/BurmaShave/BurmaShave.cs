/*From 1925 through 1963, Burma Shave advertising signs appeared next to highways all across the United States. T ere were always four or fi ve signs in a row containing pieces of a rhyme, followed by a fi nal sign that read “Burma Shave.” For example, one set of signs that has been preserved by the Smithsonian Institution reads as follows:
    Shaving brushes
    You'll soon see 'em
    On a shelf
    In some museum
    Burma Shave
 * Find a classic Burma Shave rhyme on the Web and write a program that displays it. 
 * Save the program as BurmaShave.cs
